Day 1:
  This day mostly involved planning since i am a bit hazy on the topic of arrays. i want to store the components of the factorial and display them in the traditional
  format eg: factorial of 4 = 4*3*2*1. So, i will need a array that subtracts 1 from the inserted number and store them. to print them i can simply print the array 
  index with * in the middle to give it that look. 

  i plan to write this program a bit organized so, i'll try to use alot of methods to keep the main method clean. i also created an flowchart to make it a bit clear.
  it's attached in this repository as Factorial.png 
  
  i do not want to upload half baked program so i wont be uploding it today.
  
Day 2:
  I started writing the java code and realized that the flow chart i made is obsolete and doesn't convey much significant contributions to the actual program. such so
  that i decided to delete it from this repository entirely. I just realized that you need to create an object to make array (says a lot about programming is all about making projects).
  for storing and printing the factorial components, I heavily relied on for loops and alot of counters. this project was rather simple after learning dealing with arrays.
  few while loops along with try catch were used to direct the answers in a proper format for performing calculations. this program is bit lacking due to it being capable of
  only finding the factorials of smaller numbers since it grows exponentially big after each number. for now i have patched the program just right to perform necessary calculations
  without any errors(at least the once i could find). i hope to improve this program in the near future in another programming langauge.
